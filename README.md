# Unity-2D-Game-Development
I made first version of a 2D game here with Unity by C# codes.

This game has only 6 episode.
First four episodes are progress and fifth episode is Boss episode. The last episode is another progress episode.

I used only free assets when I create the game but I will create my personal characters when the game will finished completely.

I will update when I create new episodes and new features in the future.

Please don't be hesitate to contact me for anything and give me more advise :)
